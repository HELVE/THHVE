The Isolation Cocoons

Scott enters railway station through the main doors trying to catch a train.

He’s in a hurry, looks at his watch. It’s ticking normally until the moment when

it suddenly goes really fast (time-lapse). When he looks up every activity has

stopped. He’s alone in a hall. As he goes through the corridors he slowly halts

discovering bizarre white shapes lying all around. He decides to go further

and arrives at a platform. Motionless white cocoons of people are scattered

across the platform (painting inspiration, play with light and shadow, not

revealing the forms until later on in the sequence).

Scott comes closer to one of the cocoons and starts ripping the material.

Stench of oldness in the air surrounds him as he reaches towards the heart of

the wrapped white human figure. He puts his hand inside and slowly takes out

the object.

When he looks up he realizes that not only they are scattered all over the

ground but they are also hanging from the ceiling of the station. All this

resembles to him a hive full of sleeping bees.

As he’s looking at the object puzzled, out of nowhere girl with a trumpet starts

playing in the main hallway and the awakening starts. Cocoons start to move

slightly but Scott doesn’t want to wait for them to awake completely so he

starts running towards the main hall. He can hear the sounds of ripping. Then

he stands in the middle of the hall and looks at the watch again (back pan at

the enclosing creatures). The leads move really fast. Scott covers the watch

with his hand in the last moment when the human-like beings from the cocoon

are enclosing on him.

He finds himself back at the lively train station. Someone offers him a

newspaper. He rejects it. Then he catches the train. As he sits down he

realizes there is something in his pocket. It’s the object.

FILMMAKING DIARY – OMINOUS

Written by Tymoteusz Masiakowski.

6 th August 2010 - Friday

I was thinking about passion and creativity lately and I am convinced that a

film itself is something like a filmmaker’s own life’s puzzle. It’s something

coming from within. From the depths of thought. That’s why when making the

film I want to concentrate on feeling and mood of the original idea.

Various scenes generate together a strong theme on their own. The magic

thing the writer or filmmaker does is to juxtapose those scenes and connect

them somehow. The connection is the key and not just any type of

connection, it’s the one that feels right.

This film is not aiming to be “100% entertaining”, “for-the- audience” type of

story. It’s aiming to be something profound but not only personally, as it would

be letting in the audience into a lone twisted mind, a convoluted labyrinth of

thoughts and notions. It will be exposing it for the purpose of observation and

experiment.

7 th August 2010 - Saturday

I wrote the initial version of the cocoon scene. It needs a lot of work but I can

feel the scene a lot better now. There needs to be a connection to the other

parts of the film but so far I’m working just on the overall structure of the

scene and it’s coming together pretty well.

There are things that I’m not really comfortable with in the initial write-up.

They need tuning and attachment. They need care. At least I already have a

couple of scenes playing in my head. That gives me confidence and I feel a

lot more alive.

I also feel a mysterious buzz that comes with a new project, new in an

absolute sense. New approach, new mindset and newly found courage to do

something. I haven’t felt that great in a long time.

On a side note: camera that I wanted to use to shoot the film broke yesterday.

I need to send it to repair shop before we start shooting. As usual it’s going to

take ages but I can always use the last resort lower quality cameras or borrow

from someone.

8 th August 2010 - Sunday

Cocoon scene has been finalized in form of a step outline with some

associated images for inspiration. I’m satisfied with this version but it will

obviously change in relation to the other scenes. It’s all about creation and

destruction. Repeating this cycle until the scene is right and the feeling is

preserved.

There is much to be done during the next few months but I feel mentally

prepared for what is to come. Been heavily inspired lately by an audio book

called: ‘Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness and Creativity’

written and read by David Lynch. He makes some really inspiring points that I

took into my heart. It really helped me to come clean with what I’m about to

do.

About the camera repair: it can be easily done, for about £100 so one problem

is solved. I’m starting to realize what it is to be a filmmaker. The finances of

making a film piece are sophisticated but I intend to put every penny I earn

into my idea. It’s a matter or choice and dedication.

What I’m going through is not enlightenment but rather a realization, a really

strong one. One that I’ve been waiting for.

9 th August 2010 - Monday

Had a brilliant creative night today. Plenty of ideas, the overall story is coming

together. Settled on including a relationship in it as I want to study those little

things we do in relationships. Those things that make your day when the other

person makes you feel great, acknowledging you and giving support.

What if such person is only a part of your imagination? What if that support

comes from within yourself and you are fooling yourself that it is an external

force at play?
